# time-calculator
The TIME-CALCULATOR website is being created here.
Its visualization was created in Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/tARkAm5ZBH9yc9SKlkqoq9/time-calculator?node-id=2%3A37&t=ErJzHuAtGqeXtaf2-1
On this website, you can convert time using different units of measurement. Subpages are available for registered users where you can plan your week and check in a bar chart how much time was spent on each activity. There is also a subpage where you can calculate your BMI and your daily caloric intake.
